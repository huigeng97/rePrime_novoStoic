Description:
1. rePrime 
- rePrime procedure identifies and captures as a reaction rule the molecular graph topological changes underpinning the substrate to product graph conversion. 

2. novoStoic
- An MILP procedure to identifies a mass-balanced de novo biochemical network that converts a source metabolite to a target while satisfying a multitude of constraints and optimizing the objective function.
